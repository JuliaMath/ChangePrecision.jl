# ChangePrecision

[![CI](https://github.com/JuliaMath/ChangePrecision.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JuliaMath/ChangePrecision.jl/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This package makes it easy to change the "default" precision of a large body of Julia code, simply by prefixing it with the `@changeprecision T expression` macro, for example:

```julia
@changeprecision Float32 begin
    x = 7.3
    y = 1/3
    z = rand() .+ ones(3,4)
end
```

In particular, floating-point literals like `7.3` are reinterpreted as the requested type `Float32`, operations like `/` that convert integer arguments to `Float64` instead convert to `Float32`, and random-number or matrix constructors like `rand` and `ones` default to `Float32` instead of `Float64`.
Several other cases are handled as well: arithmetic with irrational constants like `pi`, linear-algebra functions (like `inv`) on integer matrices, etcetera.

The `@changeprecision` transformations are applied recursively to any `include(filename)` call, so that you can simply do `@changeprecision Float32 include("mycode.jl")` to run a whole script `mycode.jl` in `Float32` default precision.

Code that explicitly specifies a type, e.g. `rand(Float64)`, is unaffected by `@changeprecision`.

Note that only expressions that *explicitly appear* in the `expression` (or code inserted by `include`) are converted by `@changeprecision`.  Code *hidden inside* external functions that are called is not affected.

## This package is for quick experiments, not production code

This package was designed for quick hacks, where you want to experiment with the effect of a change in precision on a bunch of code.   For production code and long-term software development in Julia, you are strongly urged to write precision-independent code â€” that is, your functions should determine their working precision from the precision of their *arguments*, so that by simply passing data in a different precision they compute in that precision.
